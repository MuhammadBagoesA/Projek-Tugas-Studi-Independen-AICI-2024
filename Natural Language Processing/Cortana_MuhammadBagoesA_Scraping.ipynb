Go! Go!\\nWhere are the vibranium tools?\\nWho has access?\\nYou perform civility here.\\nBut we know what you whisper… in your halls of leadership and in your military facilities.\\n“The King is dead.\\n“The Black Panther is gone.\\n“They have lost their protector.\\n“Now is our time…\\n“to strike.”\\nAneka, where is your spear?\\nShuri gave me these to try.\\nYou know, I like them better.\\nOur foremothers gave us the spear… because it is precise, elegant… and deadly.\\nIt will not change under my watch.\\nYes, General.\\nI told you not to bring them.\\nLast night there was another attack on one of our outreach facilities.\\nProof of the involvement of a member state… is being uploaded to your mobile devices as we speak.\\nAnd as for the identity of the attackers…\\nKneel!\\nYou’re welcome.\\nLet our gracious response to this incursion be an olive branch.\\n\\n\\n\\nFurther attempts on our resources… will be considered an act of aggression… and met with a much steeper response.\\nWe mourn the loss of our king.\\nBut do not think for a second that Wakanda has lost her ability… to protect our resources.\\nWe are aware of the ongoing efforts by some… to find vibranium outside of Wakanda… and wish you the best of luck.\\nThis is Rotor 625 requesting clearance to land.\\nAll right. Meet you down there.\\nYeah.\\nHey!\\nI thought you retired!\\nI thought I had too.\\nThey said that machine had a one in a billion chance of finding vibranium.\\nOh, less than that.\\nHere we go.\\nCabin pressure is stable at negative one PSI.\\nAt 800 feet… passing through thermocline.\\nAll my life supports in the green.\\nCopy you.\\nWe’ve touched down.\\nPerfect.

Hang on!\\nQueen Ramonda of the nation of Wakanda… \\ngave an electrifying speech at the UN yesterday… while members of her \\nmilitary escorted captive mercenaries… onto the floor of the UN.\\nA year has passed since Queen Ramonda… \\nwas reinstated as ruler of Wakanda… after King T’Challa’s sudden death \\nfrom an undisclosed illness last year.\\nAll eyes are on the tiny, powerful nation… as it finds itself increasingly isolated…\\nMy Queen.\\nApproaching the river border.\\nWe are home.\\nPrincess.\\nJust a moment. I’m in the middle of something.\\nI understand, Princess, however…\\nYou’re disrupting my train of thought.\\nShuri.\\nMother.\\nI was trying to tell you. The Queen is here.\\nThank you.\\nThat thing unnerves me.\\nI think that one day artificial intelligence is going to kill us all.\\nMy AI isn’t like the movies, Mother. It does exactly what I tell it to do.\\nYeah, if only children were the same.\\nEveryone seems to be working diligently.\\nYes. Rapid emergency response task.\\nThere could be any number of… unknown threats on the horizon, and they’re creating solutions.\\nOh, what is this?\\nExo Suits for our army.\\nIt grants the user superhuman strength, speed, and durability.\\nBut, as always, Okoye had notes.\\nWhat were her notes?\\nShe hates them.\\nWhat about recreating the HeartShaped Herb?\\nHave you made any progress on that?\\nExcuse me, Princess.\\nNakia, daughter of Yaa, is trying to reach you again.\\nMaybe you should…\\nMaybe you should continue your calculations… as I instructed.\\nAs you wish, Princess.\\nWe do not need the Herb, Mother. We need new technology.\\nWhat of the Black Panther?\\nThe mantle has unified our nation for centuries.\\nThe Black Panther is a relic, Mother.\\nI wasn’t trying to save the mantle with the Herb…\\nI was trying to save my brother.\\nOh, Shuri.\\nDo you know what day it is?\\nTuesday.\\nThe date, child.\\nBrother’s passing.\\nOne year ago today.\\nHave you planned anything?\\n\\n\\n\\nYes. It involves you taking your mother for a drive.\\nRight now?\\nRight now.\\nAnd you can leave your Kimoyo Beads here.\\nMother.\\nNo, no.\\nYou won’t need them where we are going.\\nAnd the other two. Yes.\\nYou need to sit here with me. And with yourself.\\nIt is the only way you are going to heal… from the wound caused by T’Challa’s death.\\nI’m fine, Mother.\\nYou don’t have to worry about me.\\nHe’s gone, but I’m moving forward.\\nT’Challa is dead, but that doesn’t mean he is gone.\\nWhen that illness took your brother from us… I had to lead a wounded nation and a broken world.\\nBut I still took time in the bush.\\nI wandered until I found water.\\nAnd I sat.\\nThen I did this ritual… that I am about to show you now.\\nI found your brother in the breeze… pushing me gently, but firm.\\nLike his hand on my shoulder.\\nIt took some time… but he was there.\\nHe wasn’t there, Mother.\\nThe presence that you felt… was just a construct of your mind.\\nBrought on so you could feel some comfort or joy.\\nThat’s all.\\nWhat construct does your mind create… when you think of your brother?\\nDoes it offer you comfort?\\nOr torment?\\nCome, child.\\nHow did you get this?\\nWhat does it matter?\\nWhat does this have to do with your ritual?\\nBurning of the funeral garments… marks \\nthe end of the mourning period… and the beginning of a new relationship…\\n with our loved ones that have passed on… I’m not doing this, Mother.\\nIf I sit… and think about my brother for too long… it won’t be these clothes I’ll burn.\\nIt will be the world… and everyone in it.\\nShuri… Shuri, there’s something that I need to tell you… about your brother.\\nMother, wait!\\nWhat are you doing?\\nThis better not be a part of your ritual.\\nIt isn’t.\\nStop! Right there!\\nWho are you? And how did you get in here?\\nThis place is amazing.\\nThe air is pristine.\\nAnd the water…\\nMy mother told stories about a place like this.\\nA protected land with people that never have to leave.\\nThat never have to change who they were.\\nWhat reason do you have to reveal your secret to the world?\\nI am not a woman who enjoys repeating herself.\\nWho are you?\\nI have many names.\\nMy people call me K’uk’ulkan… but my enemies call me Namor.\\nThe American military detected vibranium under my nation’s domain.\\nI was able to stop them from minin’ it… but we need Wakanda’s help to prevent it from happenin’ again.\\nThey use a machine designed by an American scientist.\\nVibranium only exists here.\\nIn Wakanda.\\nMother, he’s covered in it.\\nYour son exposed the power of vibranium to the world.\\nIn response, other nations have begun searching the planet for it.\\nHis choice has compromised us.\\nI think Wakanda could find the scientist and bring them to me?\\nIt is only fair that Wakanda helps to resolve our dilemma.\\nYou do not sneak into my country and tell me what is fair.\\nI have more soldiers than this land has blades of grass.\\nAnd they have incomparable strength.\\nI would hate to come back under different circumstances.\\nWhen you have the scientist, blow into this… place it in the ocean.\\nI’ll be there shortly afterwards.\\nFor your own sake… don’t mention anything about me to anyone outside of Wakanda.\\nDid you see the wings on his ankles?\\nHow did he do that?\\nWe must convene the Council.\\nHeaven Scrapers had no evidence of any activity at all.\\nOh, the river border has been breached?\\nIf my soldiers were present… this “fish man”… would be bound before us as we speak.\\nIf your muscle brains were present… they would still be there choking on their fuzzy adornments.\\nYou baldheaded demon…\\nShow some respect, you two.\\nRespect?\\nThese men should be ashamed to show their faces!\\nWatch your tone, Jabari!\\nAs I was saying… there was no aerial surveillance footage of him.\\nAnd nothing on the radar as well.\\nSo, he swam underwater for 100 kilometers.\\nHe was not alone. And claims to command a massive army.\\nHe wants us to deliver one American scientist?\\nSo he can kill them?\\nDo it.\\nWe never had to face an enemy with access to vibranium before.\\nAnd we have no Black Panther to protect us.\\nThat is because this wise Council allowed Killmonger to take the throne… and burn up all of your precious HeartShaped Herb.\\nM’Baku, what would you have us do?\\nWe should find the fish man and kill him.\\nIf we do what he is asking for now… what is to stop him from coming back and asking for more?\\nAs you were.\\nIs it just me, or does this keep getting uglier?\\nIt’s you.\\nSo, does it work?\\nYes.\\nThis thing can detect the altered \\nfrequency of vibranium… through water, stones, even heavy metals. \\nWhoever built this is brilliant.\\nCome, look.\\nSome are custom parts and others look like… they gathered it from a junkyard.\\nI am still struggling to believe… that vibranium exists outside of Wakanda.\\nPerhaps there was more than one meteorite.\\nOur planet is covered of mostly water, so it’s reasonable… that the other one just landed there.\\nThis changes everything that we know.\\nThe Great Mound. All of the legends and fables.\\nThose stories are seared in my mind.\\nThat sounds very painful.\\nSo we have to find this scientist after all.\\nI do have an idea.\\nI’m going to need the princess.\\nOut of the question.\\nShe is in no state to be in the field.\\nMy Queen, it may do her some good to get out.\\nIt might just be exactly what she needs.\\nBesides, I can do this American operation with my eyes closed.\\nIt’s not the Americans that I’m worried about.\\nThis Namor… he snuck past our defenses.\\nThat will never happen again.\\nHe was not alone.\\nShe’ll be with me.\\nSo… when are we leavin’… so I can see my favorite colonizer?\\nCome on.\\nYeah, I got it.\\nI got it.\\nWill you slow down?\\nYou didn’t think to call?\\nNow, why would I have your number?\\nWe are looking for the scientist who built the vibranium detector.\\nSo it was you guys in the Atlantic?\\nCome on. Mining ship.\\nLot of casualties.\\nWhat happened?\\nSeriously?\\nIt was a joint operation. Us and the SEALs.\\nThirty of their top guys, two of our best officers… friends of mine.\\nGone.\\nJust like that.\\nYou throw in the fact that they were tracking vibranium…\\nI can assure you Wakanda had nothing to do with this.\\nSo who was it?\\nGod, look, the way that this is supposed to work… is that I give you information and you reciprocate.\\nFor our own safety, we cannot tell you.\\nIt’s imperative that we get to the scientist… before anything else happens.\\nYou owe me, Ross.\\nYou owe my brother.\\nOkay, look.\\nThere are agents who have been sentenced to death… for less than I’m about to give you now.\\nAnd we got a new director.\\nShe’s watching me like a hawk.\\nWe will be very, very careful.\\nNot just careful, you gotta be fast.\\nThe US needs another machine… and this kid is the only person in the world… who knows how to build one.\\nSo they’re comin’ for her.\\nA kid?\\nHey.\\nYou forgot to Venmo me.\\nIt slipped my mind. It’s eight hundred, right?\\nEight hundred was yesterday’s price. It’s a band today.\\nThat’s predatory.\\nI built the whole robotic hand.\\nYou just corrected the grip algorithm.\\nAnd what grade did you get?\\nThanks.\\nIs that an iPhone I see?\\nPrimitive.\\nMy Queen.\\nWe have located the scientist.\\nShe is in the American equivalent of a Wakandan village school.\\nA school?\\nPlease tell me it is a professor.\\nIt’s a student, Mother.\\nWe can’t give her to Namor.\\nBring this student back to Wakanda.\\nYes, my Queen.\\nI’ve got it from here.\\nWait. Maybe I should speak with her.\\nIt will be more discreet.\\nI can be discreet.\\nWhat?\\nNothing.\\nIs it the makeup?\\nNo.\\nIt’s the wrong shade, isn’t it?\\nIt’s the right shade.\\nFenty 440. You look good.\\nI can blend in as a student.\\nI can do this.\\nYou get five minutes.\\nYes!\\nYo!\\nRiri Williams?\\nYo, I don’t do dropbys no more. You gotta go to the website.\\nIt’s an encrypted file.\\nI wanted to airdrop it.\\nYou the…\\nYou’re Princess Shuri.\\nWhat the hell are you doing here?\\nOh, shit, am I getting recruited?\\nNo.\\nI’m here about the vibranium detector that you built for the CIA.\\nI ain’t built no detector for no CIA. I made that for my metallurgy class.\\nA school project?\\nYeah.\\nMy professor said I’d never be able to do it.\\nTo be young, gifted, and Black though, right?\\nY’all probably don’t say that in Wakanda.\\nHow old are you?\\nNineteen.\\nBrilliance at a young age is not always accepted by the elders.\\nHow long did it take you?\\nCouple months.\\nCouple months?\\nThe hardest part was… finding big enough mylar sheets to cover the…\\nWait, did I piss off Wakanda?\\nNot just us.\\nThis place is no longer safe for you.\\nGather your things and come with me. Right now.\\nI got Differential Equations class in, like, 15 minutes.\\nOkay.\\nOkay.\\nYou wait right here.\\nI’m gonna go to the bathroom. I’m just gonna…\\nI had it under control.\\nI said five minutes. I gave you six.\\nGet out. Get out of my dorm.\\nGet out!\\nHey.\\nI’m warning you! Do not take another step toward me!\\nSee how they teach the children to treat their guests?\\nYou brought a spear in here?\\nYou brought a spear in here.\\nI like her.\\nHey, hey, hey. Put it down, put it…\\nYou’ll hurt yourself. Come on.\\nIt’s all right, Princess.\\nSmall, small girl.\\nI am going to give you two options.\\nYou can come to Wakanda… conscious or unconscious.\\nYou need to be conscious of the way that you look.\\nWalking round here, all that ash on your head.\\nOh, it’s funny?\\nNo, it’s not.\\nI told you!\\nYou look good.\\nCalm down. We’ll leave, okay?\\nAnd she can deal with that merman with the winged ankles… who wants to kill her all by herself.\\nYou got this.\\nWith your heater.\\nCome on. Let’s go.\\nWhat?\\nWhat exactly is this place?\\nI fixed a few trucks for the head of sanitation.\\nHe lets me work out of this garage in exchange.\\nI just have to grab my work laptop.\\nPlease don’t touch anything.\\nYou don’t have to worry about that.\\nIt may not look like much, but it’s my life’s work in here.\\nSo, the design for the machine is on that laptop?\\nYeah.\\nAnd you just leave it on a desk in a car garage?\\nI got 2065byte encryption on that thing.\\nThat’s impressive. Ever locked yourself out?\\nTook me the whole semester to get back in.\\nHad to build a functional quantum computer… just to crack my own encryption.\\nWhat is it you’re building here? Is it Stark Tech?\\nI said don’t touch anything.\\nPrincess, American law enforcement has arrived at your location.\\nShit.\\nWho was that?\\nMy AI.\\nThey are surrounding us.\\nI thought you said a merman was after me.\\nThat’s the feds.\\nI do not need this shit right now!\\nI swear to God, I was doing so well!\\nGoin’ to class on time. I must be dumb as hell.\\nReal dumb thinking that the Princess of Wakanda… is gonna show up at my doorstep and then shit about to pop off.\\nI think that I’m actually gonna take my chances with this merman… because at least he never brought the FBI to my garage!\\nHey. Namor sank an entire ship of CIA operatives…\\nThis is the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\\n…because of your little machine.\\nSo those popo out there…\\nWe have surrounded the premises.\\n…are the very least of your worries.\\nListen, we need to work together to get out of here.\\nGeneral, they’ve got us surrounded.\\nMaybe we should just split up.\\nOut of the question.\\nDoes this vehicle work?\\nNo.\\nEverything in this lab works. Including this bike.\\nDon’t even think about it. Besides, there are three of us.\\nTwo of y’all. I’m takin’ this.\\nI knew it.\\nDon’t tell me that you built this in two months.\\nI spent years on this. On and off.\\nNice. Have you flown it yet?\\nThat thing can fly?\\nThere’s an entire YouTube channel dedicated to sightings of me.\\nThat’s awesome.\\nWe have a warrant to detain…\\nCome.\\n…the student Riri Williams.\\nWireless transmitter… so we can communicate.\\nDon’t try to scurry off.\\nGeneral Okoye, Princess Shuri… come out with your hands up.\\nWhat a hunk of junk.\\nHey, please be careful.\\nYou will not be placed under arrest.\\nKeys are on the seat.\\nOnce we get to the other side of the bridge… we can lose them in Boston traffic.\\nGeneral, we really need to split up.\\nListen to me. We are not in your lab. We are in the field.\\nNow, get her in the car.\\nAlways shouting at me.\\nThe tactical unit will breach the entrance in three, two… one.\\nFBI! Don’t move!\\nWhat the hell is that?\\nOh, shit! She got an Iron Man suit? Fall back!\\nStay where you are!\\nGuess it can fly.\\nGRIOT!\\nYes, Princess.\\nNow!\\nRemote piloting activated.\\nShuri! No!\\nLet’s go!\\nGRIOT.\\nGive me a visual.\\nGRIOT…\\nYes, General?\\n…take me to the princess… or I will \\ndrive my spear so deep into your CPU… you will not be able to process \\nbasic input for a millennia.\\nJust one moment, General.\\nOkoye, I’m on my way to you.\\nGRIOT, give me control of this vehicle right now!\\nI am clearing you a path.\\nShe’s all yours, General.\\nManual drive engaged.\\nWe need to find an extraction point.\\nThere’s one across the river.\\nHey, yo, they cuttin’ off the bridge.\\nPrincess, there is a surveillance drone locked onto you.\\nHow high?\\nThirtythousand feet.\\nHang on.\\nI got it.\\nCome on, Riri.\\nYou gotta find these differential equations.\\nOnce the relative velocity evens out…\\nRiri, I’m not sure you can reach that drone… without an oxygen mask.\\nOxygen level is now 55%.\\nTwenty-eight thousand feet.\\nOxygen level is now 30%.\\nMaximum acceleration. I just need to adjust my Euler angles and that should… drop it right on the…\\nOxygen, 0%.\\nThe drone is no longer tracking you.\\nAltitude, 500 feet and falling.\\nRiri! Are you okay?\\nRiri!\\nYeah.\\nI’m good.\\nIncoming!\\nGet out of the way!\\nOh my!\\nShit!\\nAnd no worries.\\nI got a special delivery for y’all in three… two, one…\\nNice one, Riri!\\nRiri!\\nWhat just happened? Shuri!\\nShuri!\\nThe Princess’s vitals are stable, General.\\nShe should regain consciousness momentarily.\\nTake another step closer… and I will kill you all.\\nDrop your weapons!\\nKill the scientist.\\nI’ll deal with the witnesses.\\nOK.\\nHey, is she blue?\\nKill that woman first.\\nDrop your weapon!\\nGo to Namora.\\nYou’re not worth my blade.\\nWhat’s taking so long?\\nThis is not a time for games.\\nOkoye!\\nWait!\\nActivating interpretation.\\nI’m Shuri.\\nPrincess of Wakanda.\\nI demand that you take me to Namor.\\nDo not bring harm to this girl.\\nDo we take them both alive?\\nYes, Attuma.\\nBreathe.\\nShuri!\\nRoss, from the Agency. You got any witnesses?\\nNone. But we think it was the Wakandans.\\nExcuse me?\\nOur field office got a tip from Langley that they were coming.\\nRight. Who made that call?\\nShe did.\\nDirector de Fontaine.\\nDirector de Fontaine.\\nReally?\\nWell…\\nAgent thinks it was the Wakandans.\\nYeah, we’ve been on every one of them since they took out our ship.\\nThat’s why I wanted you here.\\nYou’re lookin’ good.\\nWell, I try.\\nYou put that home gym in?\\nYeah. Last year.\\nMaybe I’ll drop by sometime and jump on your Peloton.\\nHowdy.\\nI’m special agent in charge.\\nOh, good for you. You wanna walk me through the evidence here, or what?\\nYeah. Okay. After you.\\nYeah. Okay.\\nAll right.\\nSo, what happened here?\\nWe think it was a car crash… but we’re having trouble finding the cars.\\nWhat do you mean? It was just like this when you found it?\\nYes.

I’ll be right back. -Okay.\\nWait, didn’t you tell us the wizard disintegrated?\\nThe skin peeled off his face.\\nHe turned into a literal pile of ash.\\nYeah, seems definitive.\\nI dunno.\\nYeah. Except now he’s in my dreams\\nand, Freddy, he’s trying to give me a message.\\n[snaps fingers] Could be astral projection powers.\\nWhat’s that?\\nObi-Wan Kenobi-ing you\\nfrom the great beyond?\\nThat’s it, I’m calling\\nan emergency meeting after school.\\nI want you there.\\nWhere else am I gonna go?\\nWhat?\\nDude.\\n[Freddy reading indistinctly]\\nOkay, first of all, I didn’t explode it!\\nAll right? It was already like that and, and, and…\\nWhat is that, the Tribune? It’s fake news!\\nFreddy, we only have one rule.\\n[both] All or none.\\nAnd it’s a stupid rule, by the way.\\nI have a girl talking to me, Billy.\\nA girl. For the first time in my life!\\nAnd I probably don’t have a shot in hell with this girl,\\nbut I’ll never find out\\nif you keep trying to control everything I wanna do!\\nJust be at the Rock, Freddy.\\n[sighs] Okay. Mmm.\\nBy the way, uh, she has a sister.\\nTotal control freak.\\nI think you guys would get along.\\nThink you’d love her, actually.\\n[Shazam] Look, look, look. Fam,\\nI know it sounds crazy.\\nAnd, and obviously I don’t know\\nexactly what this all means\\nbut, but he was super aggro\\nand super loud and he was trying to warn us, I think.\\nHe was yelling about all this\\nwizard-y mumbo-jumbo about realms and stuff.\\nDo you have to talk so loud?\\nYeah, Mary, ’cause this is not that loud.\\nI think this is a perfectly acceptable indoor voice volume.\\nWhat is the deal? Are you okay?\\nYeah.\\nWhy do you have sunglasses on?\\nDid you go to the eye doctor this morning?\\n[snorts]\\n[Shazam chuckles]\\nI dunno, it looks to me like Mary did go to the eye doctor,\\nbut it was last night, and she had a lot of fun.\\nIn point of fact, I did have a great time.\\nI met other people my age and I enjoyed myself.\\nYou made friends at the eye doctor?\\nNo, she…\\nYeah, can we get back on track?\\nListen, he’s yelling at me\\nand he’s saying the daughters of Atlas\\nare coming to hunt us.\\nSo, check out what I found.\\n“The daughters of Atlas are the offspring\\nof the Titan Atlas…”\\nwhich is obvious,\\nbut also Nyx, the Goddess of Night and Death.\\nWell, good things can happen at night.\\nAnd death.\\n[sighs]\\nLet me see this.\\n[intriguing music playing]\\n“The daughters guard the mythic Tree of Life\\nwhich grows golden apples that contain the seeds of life\\nwhich gave birth to their realm\\nprotected by a…\\ndragon.”\\nHey, now.\\nAnd I am suddenly here for this.\\nI know, right?\\n‘Cause, like, on one hand, totally terrifying.\\nOn the other hand, dragon!\\nDragon!\\nMary. What are we doin’?\\nI don’t know, man. This is your meeting.\\nRight, yes, fine, but we all need to be on the same page\\nand, and, and look,\\nI often think that you think better than me.\\nThe wizard did not exactly give me a tutorial here, guys, okay?\\nLike, I don’t know how a lot of this stuff works.\\nThat, that room of doors, or that violin\\nthat is, like, constantly burning which is super weird but also\\ndefinitely keeps the lair cozy, right?\\nHe didn’t even tell me my superhero name.\\nAnd it’s not like I’m not tryin’.\\nBut I really, really need your help.\\nUh, I might know somebody that can help.\\nShut up. That lights up?\\n[rumbling]\\nShut up.\\n[enchanting music playing]\\nSo, I’m mapping out the entire lair\\nand you withhold this?\\n[Shazam] And you have really been holding out on us.\\nJeez Louise, dude.\\nWhoa!\\n[Shazam] “Whoa” what?\\n“Whoa” what?\\n[superhero Darla] Look!\\n[superhero Darla chuckles]\\nHey, Steve.\\n[chuckles] What? You call the pen “Steve”?\\nYeah, I thought he looked like a “Steve.”\\n[superhero Darla] He totally looks like a “Steve.”\\n“‘Crime and Punishment, ‘ a book report by Pedro Pena?” -Yeah.\\n[Shazam laughs]\\nPedro.\\nDude, that’s cheating.\\nI mean, he knows everything.\\nHmm.\\nSeriously. Ask him.\\nYou can just ask him stuff?\\nPretty much.\\n[Shazam] Slick. Okay, cool.\\nSteve, we’re looking for information\\nabout the daughters of Atlas.\\nCan you please help us with that?\\nThese are book titles.\\n[Shazam] Okay.\\nLet’s just all pick a book, or something.\\nWhere’s Freddy? I mean, obscure mythology?\\nDefinitely his thing.\\nI’m not even sure Freddy knows what his thing is anymore.\\n[people chattering]\\nYou know I’ve actually never, never been up here.\\nDon’t lie. [chuckles] This is where you hang out\\nwith your superhero friends, isn’t it?\\nNo, actually, why would they ever have to… Why would they ever come here?\\nI mean they have, yes, they’ve driven by…\\nDo you actually know those guys?\\nOr is this like a “Canadian girlfriend” situation?\\nOh, you mean Collette? Well, she and I\\naren’t really exclusive, as of now.\\n[chuckles]\\nDo you wanna meet one of them?\\nMeet, like how?\\nLike, face-to-face, right now.\\nI’m gonna take that as a yes.\\nAnd today is your lucky day,\\nbecause I’m gonna call the hot one.\\nHer?\\nNo, the male hot one.\\nHim?\\nWhat? Him?\\nLook, I mean, it’s all subjective, right? But, um…\\nCaptain Everypower usually tops most online polls\\nso… It’s no big deal.\\nIs this a joke, Freddy?\\n‘Cause I didn’t mean to make you actually prove it, really.\\nNo, it’s not a joke. And I’m gonna\\ncall him right now. I’m gonna call him right now.\\nSo, don’t move. So, stay right there.\\nHey, Captain Everypower. What’s goin’ on?\\nIt’s your boy Freddy. Yeah.\\nRemember that time I saved your life?\\nNo, no, no, the other time.\\nYeah.\\nWell, I’m calling in that favor.\\n[lightning cracks]\\n[heroic music plays]\\nYou must be Anne.\\n[gasps] Oh, my God.\\nFriend of Freddy’s, I hear.\\nI am, actually. Yeah. How are you…\\n[sighs] You know, I may be the one with the superpowers,\\nbut that kid,\\nhe’s the real hero.\\nYeah. I mean, honestly,\\nI’ve never met anyone like him.\\nHe’s… genuine\\nand warm and funny. [chuckles]\\nThat’s a lot of nice things.\\nYeah.\\nHow did you two meet?\\nComic Con.\\nWhat’s Comic Con?\\nWhat?\\n[superhero Mary] According to this,\\ngods considered humans servants,\\ntoys to be played with,\\nchildren to be punished.\\n[chuckles] Thanks, Steve.\\nUntil the rebellion when the humans turned on the gods.\\nI’m reading about that right now.\\nSo, apparently, all of this\\nrevolves around a powerful weapon.\\nSo Atlas, uh, the father\\nof the daughters of Atlas, obviously, yeah,\\nhe crafted a quarterstaff from the Tree of Life\\nand he used that staff to give powers to certain deities\\nbut also to take powers away from others.\\nSo, the staff’s where Atlas stored all supernatural power.\\nYes, exactly. It’s like a, a battery for magic.\\nBut when things got bad,\\na council of human wizards got together and they\\nstole the staff from Atlas.\\nAnd they used that to take his powers away.\\nAnd once they had his magic they went after other gods…\\nGuys, that’s the wizard! I know this guy,\\nthis is the wizard that I know!\\nWhat do these say?\\n“The Wisdom of Solomon,\\nStrength of Hercules, Stamina of Atlas,\\nPower of Zeus, Courage of Achilles,\\nSpeed of Mercury.” These are the powers they stole.\\nNo.\\nWhoa, guys, look!\\nThis is what the name means.\\nWhich is way cooler than what I thought it was,\\nwhich is just a bunch of hot garbage, so.\\nIf I may point out one of the powers that may be possibly MIA.\\nBoop.\\n[Shazam] I’m sorry,\\nare you very unsubtly implying\\nthat I somehow lack the wisdom of\\nSolo Man?\\nYeah.\\nWell, maybe it comes later.\\nI mean you do usually ask Mary what to do.\\nI’m just saying.\\nYeah.\\nThis is very, very hurtful.\\nI just want you all to know that.\\nAnd it’s pronounced “Solomon.”\\nOh.\\n[Shazam clears throat]\\nWhat else have we learned, fam?\\nWell, once the staff contained the powers of the gods,\\nthe wizards apparently encased the God Realm in some\\nmagical sphere\\nsealing it away forever.\\nCut off from magic.\\nOh, so that’s what that was about.\\nYeah, I don’t think that they are so cut off anymore.\\nA bizarre and gruesome scene unfolded\\nin Athens, Greece this morning.\\nTwo women dressed in what appears to be ancient Greek…\\nWhoa, whoa, whoa, that’s the wizard’s staff. How did they get that?\\nSo, all those statues used to be people.\\nI’m wondering, how did the staff end up in Europe,\\nwhere Greece is at?\\nOh, gee-whiz, mister, sorry I took your cane.\\nYou want it back?\\nI mean, I did break it in half and then throw it away.\\nSo, that’s probably where the journey started.\\nYou know?\\nWhat?\\nWhat do you mean, “What?” What?\\nYou just left it there?\\nWe were all there.\\nGuys, I had a staff. I gave you all superpowers.\\nYou’re welcome, by the way.\\nAnd then I had to break it in half so Sivana didn’t do\\nsuper bad-guy stuff with it, okay?\\nYou broke the staff,\\nmeaning you broke the barrier between worlds.\\nWhich we now know.\\nWe also now know what they look like,\\nso when they come to hunt us, we’ll see those two\\ncoming a…\\nThree.\\nWhat?\\nAtlas had three daughters.\\nKalypso, Hespera,\\nAnthea.\\nAnne… thea.\\nYou know, I’m not just a superhero.\\nI’m a super listener.\\nAnd…\\nI sense…\\nthat you may have feelings for Freddy.\\nJust wanna know when he’s coming back.\\nDon’t want him to get hurt.\\nOh, well, Anne… [sighs] I mean, we can’t choose\\nthe people we fall for.\\nWhat?\\nI’m not talking about that.\\nIf he shows up now, he’s in serious danger.\\nWhoa! Look who you’re with.\\nWhat could possibly be dangerous?\\nUs.\\nOkay.\\nI see how it is.\\nLet’s dance.\\n[groaning]\\nOh, my God.\\nFreddy?\\nOw!\\nOh, Freddy, I, I didn’t know.\\nI never meant for you to get hurt.\\nOh, I’m not the one who’s gonna get hurt.\\nShazam!\\nShazam!\\nShazam.\\nWhat’s going on up here?\\n[Freddy] Mis…\\nFreddy, are you all right?\\nGet back inside. Just get back inside, Mr. Geckle.\\nI’m okay. Go back inside.\\nWho are you? Do you have kids here?\\nWhat are you doing? Don’t hurt him.\\nI won’t touch him. You have my word.\\n[whispering in other language]\\n[skin squelching]\\n[magical voices whispering]\\n[in English] Mr. G. Wha…\\nWhat did she say? What are you doing?\\nWhat are you doing?\\nWhat are you… no, no, no!\\nStop, stop, stop! Wait, wait, wait! Hey, no, no, no!\\nWait, no, no, no!\\n[screaming]\\n[body thuds]\\nI forgot how easily they burst.\\nWhy would you do that?\\nLike grapes.\\n[sobs]\\n[magic resonates]\\nWhat the… Huh?\\n[Freddy yelping]\\n[gasps]\\nNow, child, tell us where to find the others.\\nNo need.\\n[dramatic music playing]\\n[Freddy yelps, grunts]\\nClip his wings, Anthea.\\n[magic trilling]\\n[Shazam grunting]\\n[grunting]\\n[chuckling]\\nOw.\\nWait.\\nThere are more.\\n[exclaims]\\n[heroic music playing]\\nPerfect. We take them all.\\nNo.\\nThat’s not why we’re here.\\nWe’re here for the seed of life. Yield, sister.\\nWe stick to the plan we have.\\nFather would never yield.\\nAnd Father is dead.\\nNow, you know your place, sister.\\nOr I will show it to you.\\nWe do this our way, not theirs.\\n[Shazam grunts]\\n[Hespera] Make one move…\\n[magic resonates]\\n[screaming]\\n[choking]\\nAnd I will snap this child’s neck.\\n[choking]\\n[dramatic music playing]\\nOh, Freddy.\\n[Freddy grunts]\\n[Shazam grunts]\\nBilly, no!\\n[speaking in other language]\\n[magic resonating]\\n[Freddy in English] Billy, stay back!\\nThey’re using the staff to take our powers.\\n[grunts, gasps]\\nWhat? What? [gasps]\\n[grunting]\\n[grunting]\\n[crackling]\\n[yells]\\nSorry!\\n[Freddy] I’m sorry,\\nI’m sorry, just, just save yourself.\\nNo, no, all or none. We stick together.\\nAnd that you will because you cannot leave.\\nLet’s see how you like being sealed off in a dying world.\\n[Freddy] No!\\nNo!\\nFreddy!\\n[news anchor] From City Line Avenue in the north\\nto the western shore of the Schuylkill River\\nto Cobbs Creek.\\nThe unidentified barrier appears\\nto be in the shape of a dome\\nwith no one allowed into the city or out\\nwith some suggesting this strange magical element\\nmay be the doing, or undoing, of the Philadelphia Fiascoes.\\n[ominous music playing]\\n[yelps]\\n[breathing shakily]\\nHoly sh…\\n[wizard] Shh!\\n[gasps]\\n[wizard] I’m trying to sleep.\\nIt is the only escape from the tortures here.\\nOkay.

Yeah, he’s my best friend.\\nI’m… I’m Freddy Freeman, Captain Everypower.\\nWell, used to be. It’s complicated now.\\nShe… It’s complicated.\\nThat halfwit Billy gave you the powers of Shazam?\\nYeah, he did. And he said that you turned into ash, but, but didn’t?\\n[grunts]\\nOnce I gave him the power,\\nI could no longer remain in my realm.\\nBut death would have been a luxury\\ncompared to being trapped in this cell\\nwith the knowledge of my failure, and with you.\\nMostly with you.\\nA little more sarcastic than Billy said,\\nbut, hey, all good.\\nLet’s just get out of here.\\n“Let’s just get out of here.”\\nYeah, sure.\\nI sound nothing like that, but okay.\\nHere’s what we’ve got, um…\\nA cranky wizard with a cynical streak\\nand a precocious young man with an encyclopedic knowledge regarding magical shit.\\nThere is no way these sisters are keeping us in here.\\nThese prison bars, they’re probably enchanted!\\nWhat spells do you know?\\nPlease, stop talking.\\nHow about an arcane focus?\\nI don’t even know what that is.\\n[groans]\\nFine, then let’s make a potion.\\nLike a potion of, um, giant strength or diminution.\\nOh! Gaseous form!\\nYeah! Maybe we could float out of here like a fart.\\nI gave my powers to children who squandered it.\\nWe will die here, Freeby.\\nIt’s Freddy, by the way. “Freeby”? Where do you even…\\nThe sooner you accept it,\\nthe easier it will be.\\nIs this a tooth? There’s a tooth in here!\\nHmm.\\n[foreboding music playing]\\n[superhero Mary] “Power of elements. Power of chaos.\\nPower of axis.”\\nThese are primordial forces.\\nI don’t know how we fight powers like this.\\nI tell you how we fight it.\\nWith the wisdom of…\\nSolomon.\\nExactly.\\nWe, we set up a meeting.\\nYeah, we tell ’em we want to negotiate.\\nOffer up our powers for Freddy.\\nBut then we grab one of them\\nand that’s what we really use to trade!\\nBut what if they steal our powers?\\nNo, they won’t, ’cause we know how they work now.\\nYou know what I mean? If they just point that staff at us, we dodge.\\n[imitates whooshing sounds] Like dodgeball.\\nHmm.\\nDude, I suck at dodgeball.\\nWell, maybe Pedro sucks at dodgeball,\\nbut not Super Pedro.\\nNo, Super Pedro also sucks at dodgeball.\\nFine. Listen, all I know is that there’s five of us and three of them.\\nSo I think we should send them a little invitation.\\nOkay.\\nSo, Steve says that this paper\\nis a stack of magical parchment.\\nYou write a message on the magical paper\\nand say the name of the god that you would like to talk to\\nand then the paper folds into a…\\n[gasps] Oh, my God, yes!\\nA paper bird.\\nAnd it flies to the god.\\n[Super Hero Eugene] Well, that’s kinda cute.\\nHey, what about demigods?

Chocolate?\\nWhat’s with the lightsaber?\\nIt’s not a lightsaber.\\nJesus Christ, Adam.\\nI need you to play it cool.\\nWait.\\nI know playing it cool isn’t your thing.\\nWait.\\nIt never has been…\\nWait, wait! How do you know my name?\\nYou’re Adam Reed. Born February 10th, 2010.\\nYour parents are Ellie and Louis Reed. Louis would’ve died about a year ago.\\nYou don’t play any sports because of acute asthma.\\nPlus you’re freakishly small for 12.\\n[frantic barking]\\nYou go to Franklin Middle School,\\nwhere you’ve been suspended two, three times for fighting,\\nwhich is ironic because you can’t fight to save your life.\\n[in unison] Hawking! Zip it!\\n[whines]\\nHow do you know my dog’s name?\\nBecause I named him.\\nWhere are you goin’?\\n[gasps]\\n[wheezing]\\nOh God.\\n[shakes inhaler] All right.\\nHere, ready? Deep breath.\\nHold it.\\nThree, two, one.\\n[exhales]\\nEverybody gets a trophy.\\n[grunts]\\nWhen I was seven,\\nI ran into a table on the patio.\\nI got 12 stitches.\\n[in unison] Right here.\\nYou knew how to get into my dad’s garage.\\nYou knew how to close the fridge.\\nYou knew how to time my breathing.\\nWe have the same scar.\\nAnd you’re wearing my dad’s watch.\\nThis watch.\\nThis watch.\\nYou’re me.\\nHoly shi…\\nThat’s classified. But yes…\\nI once was.\\n[coughs]\\n[wound farts]\\nI can’t believe you’re future me.\\nOkay, you came to terms with that pretty quickly.\\nIt’s a little disturbing, actually.\\nSo why are you here?\\nRescue mission.\\nI wasn’t supposed to land here. I was aiming for 2018.\\nI need to get there as soon as possible.\\nWho were you trying to save in 2018?\\nReally?\\nFine. Can you at least tell me how you got here?\\nI’ll show ya.\\n[whooshing]\\n[power crackles and fades]\\nWhat was that?\\nCrap.\\nWhat?\\nUh, we’re gonna switch to plan A, which is where you come in.\\nYou see, time jets, like all tech in the future,\\nis coded to its user’s DNA.\\nBecause I’m injured… aah, the jet won’t even clear me to fly,\\nwhich means I can’t get in there to fix her.\\nBut guess who can?\\n[whirring]\\n[power building]\\n[engine humming]\\nThere she is.\\n[dramatic music playing]\\n[Adam] Away we go.\\nOkay. Sit down.\\nOh my God.\\nYeah, yeah, yeah. Sit down.\\nLet’s see what we’re dealing with here. All right, some minor shield damage.\\nCoolant leaks.\\n[beeping]\\nI don’t know what that is, but when is a flashing red light ever good?\\nAh-da-da-da-da-da.\\nI know you wanna touch all the pretty buttons\\nwith your sticky little child fingers, but the reactor has a quantum signature.\\nYou fire it up, they can find us.\\nIf they’re here.\\nWho are “they”?\\nI’m glad that you didn’t ask me that because “they” are classified.\\nI already know you’re from the future.\\nBelieve me, I regret that.\\nI had no intention of coming back to revisit… this.\\nJesus. Okay.\\n[chiming]\\nOkay, I’ve isolated the damaged relays,\\nso the ship should be able to start repairing itself.\\nHow long will that take?\\nAh, it’s at 50% capacity,\\nso hopefully less time than it takes me to heal.\\n[young Adam] Wait.\\nDo you remember this?\\nRemember what?\\nThis. Right here, right now.\\nYou being here in 2022?\\nKnow where you’re going with this.\\nIf this is happening to me…\\nYou’re wasting your time.\\nThat means it already happened to you.\\nUnless it works like a multiverse,\\nwhere each ripple creates an alternate timeline…\\nIt’s not a multiverse!\\nMy God, we watched too many movies.\\nI just wanna know.\\n[sighs]\\nOkay.\\nOkay, the prevailing wisdom is that when I go back to my fixed time,\\nmy memory… our memories, they reform, they reconcile.\\nBut not while I’m here.\\nFixed time? What’s that?\\nThere’s only one place in time where you belong on a quantum level,\\nwhere you’re not screwing around with the cosmos like I am.\\nThat is your fixed time.\\nWhere you actually belong.\\nSo by being here and telling me this,\\nyou may have just changed my whole future?\\nHonestly? Your future is pretty tragic either way.\\n[laughs] I’m kidding! I’m kidding.\\nI’m not kidding.\\nI’m kidding. Let’s go. Come on. Here we go.\\n[young Adam] So what happens now?\\nNothin’. I’m just gonna lay down.

I’m surprised you’re still up.\\nWell, this night’s been full of surprises, mother.\\nThat’s chilling. What happened?\\nHow was your not-a-date? Will you be seeing him again?\\nNo. I don’t know. I don’t think so.\\n[knocking at door]\\nHi.\\nHi.\\nMe again.\\nYes, it is.\\nYou left your scarf in my car.\\nI did. Gosh, thanks.\\n[Derek] Oh, hey there, kiddo.\\nOh. This is my son, Adam.

Of course I am.\\nSo tell him.\\nYou should tell him.\\nI don’t think he needs it.\\nYou think you’re being strong for him,\\nand the problem with acting like you have it all together is…\\nHe believes it.\\nMaybe he needs to know that you don’t.\\nIt’s okay if you don’t.\\n[Adam chuckles]\\nMy husband had a jacket just like that.\\nOh, this is a classic.\\nYeah.\\nIt was really nice chatting with you.

We should get into that.\\nThank you.\\nMet in the academy.\\nShe was 20 minutes late to the wrong classroom\\nin the wrong building.\\nI offered to walk her to the right one, and…\\nMan, I was all in before we even made it outside.\\nA couple of years ago, she didn’t come back from a jump.\\nThey told me her jet broke up on reentry, but she was the best pilot in the program.\\nShe wrote the book on reentry. Didn’t make sense.\\nAnd you were trying to get to 2018 ’cause that’s where she went before?\\nYeah.\\nWhat was she doing there?\\nI don’t know.\\nThey changed the jump logs.\\nSomebody was hidin’\\xa0somethin’.\\nMaybe she saw something Sorian didn’t want her to see.\\nWait, “Sorian”? Maya Sorian, Dad’s partner?\\nShe was always so nice to me.\\nHmm.\\nYeah, trust me. She’s no friend.\\nNope.\\nAfter Dad died, she got rich off of his tech.\\nBought all the right people.\\nNext thing you know,\\nshe has exclusive control over the most valuable resource on Earth,\\ntime.\\nWait a minute. You’re saying Dad invented time travel?\\nYeah.\\nNot on purpose.\\nThe magnetic particle accelerator. Remember that?\\nHe called it The Adam Project.\\n[Adam] Yeah, or as I like to call it, his favorite child.\\nSo what happened to Laura?\\nMmm. Well, I think your nice friend Maya had her killed.\\nWhat?\\nYeah.\\nThat’s why I gotta get back to 2018 as soon as possible.\\nThe jet’s almost ready. I’ll lay low in the shed.\\nI’ll heal for a few more days until I can get a clean read\\nand then fly out of your life.\\nBut going back to save her.\\nTalking to me.\\n[whines]\\nEverything you’re doing right now just to rescue one person.\\nYou’re changing the future.

Did I do that?\\nGod, I hope the boss lets me kill you.\\n[chuckles] In fairness, though, you did shoot me first.\\nOn the bright side, your… your face now matches your soul.\\nAnyone say you talk too much?\\nAll the time.\\nIt’s come up.\\n[Sorian] That’s enough.\\nAdam, before this goes any further, let’s just go home, please.\\nUh, no!\\nJust… just no.\\nSo you’re risking your own young life\\nover some paranoid delusion that I somehow killed Laura.\\nI loved Laura.

I wonder what it i… Was it because he’s narcissistic,\\nor, uh, never came home from work\\nor cared more about his job than his son…\\nIt’s because he died.\\nYou hate him\\nbecause he died.\\nYou made yourself hate him\\nbecause it was easier than missing him.\\nAnd I remember some stuff that you maybe don’t wanna.\\nOh yeah?\\nLike what?\\nHe played catch with us\\nalmost every night.\\nCatch.\\nHe’d get home from work,\\nbe so tired, and I’d be in the yard throwing the ball against the pitch back.\\nYou remember the pitch back, right?\\nOh, I… I remember the pitch back.\\nYeah, he bought it so he didn’t have to play with me.\\nNope.\\nHe bought it because they had one in the window of Altman’s.\\nAnd every time we passed that store,\\nI begged him to buy it for me,\\nso that’s what Dad did.\\nHe’d see me throwin’ in the yard, and no matter how tired he was,\\nhe’d always grab his mitt to come out for a catch.\\nThings happened to you, to us.\\nAnd we suck at dealing with it.\\nI’m starting to think it’s something we do.\\nI give Mom a hard time now, and…\\nI think…\\nI think it’s easier to be angry than it is to be sad.\\nAnd I guess, when I get older,\\nI forget that there’s a difference.\\nHow’d you get to be so smart?\\nHow’d you get to be so dumb?\\n[sighs]\\nNice try, asshole.\\n[Ellie] Adam, make sure you feed Hawking before you leave for school, honey.\\nOh.\\n[sizzling]\\nYou’re still here.\\n[Louis] Oh.\\nAnd you’re cooking.

Then why are you here, Dad?\\nBecause you can’t do it without me.\\n[sighs]\\nSome people dream of the future.\\nHere at Sorian Technologies, we’re building it.\\n[Louis] If you destroy the accelerator, Sorian will simply rebuild it.\\n[Adam] So what will work?\\n[Louis] What you’re after is\\xa0ISPCA.\\nInfinitely Shifting Plasma Containing Algorithm,\\nwhich I designed to stabilize the wormholes.\\nThat is the mathematical equation that will make time travel possible.\\nHow do you destroy math?\\nI’ve never written the algorithm down or demonstrated it to another human being,\\nso it lives here in the old bean,\\nand in the subbasement in a diamond-hard neuromorphic processor.\\nAre you talking about your penis?\\nCan… can we be serious now?\\nYes. No. Yes.\\nIt’s a hard drive, okay?\\n[chuckles]\\nGod, you’re such a child.\\nSorry.\\nThere is a crystal hard drive running the algorithm in a closed loop.\\nThat is the nerve center of the accelerator.\\nSo we go there, destroy the hard drive, prevent time travel from being invented.\\nTheoretically, time travel…\\nOh my God!

We really don’t have to do all…\\nYou’re amazing.\\n[Adam] Okay.\\nI love you.\\nI get it, Dad.\\nI don’t think you do.\\nI am proud of you.\\nOkay.\\n[Louis] I love you, son.\\nKnow that inside your heart. Know… Come here.\\nCome here.\\n[Adam sobs]\\n[Louis] You’re my boys, and you’ll always be my boys.\\nThroughout all time.\\n[Adam sniffles] I love you, Dad.\\n[Louis] I love you, buddy.\\n[whispers] Don’t carry this around anymore.\\nI need you, Dad.\\nIt’s so hard without you.\\nI know.\\nYou’re gonna be okay.\\nYou’re gonna be better than okay.\\nYou don’t know that.\\nAre you kidding me?\\nHave you seen this guy?\\n[chuckles]\\nThere’s gotta be somethin’ we can do.\\nI can think of somethin’.\\n[Adam] You really gonna do this?\\nOy.\\n[chuckles]\\nAll right.\\nAll right. Can you do me a favor?\\nI don’t know if we’re gonna remember any of this,\\nbut maybe there’ll be an echo or somethin’, like Laura said.\\nBut just in case,\\ngive Mom a hug for me.\\nWould you do that?\\nNot one of your lame-ass side hugs either.\\nI’m talkin’ the break-a-rib kinda hug. Yeah?\\nYeah.\\nHoly shit.\\nWhat?\\nI spent 30 years trying to get away from the me that was you.\\nAnd I’ll tell you what, kid.\\nI hate to say it, but you were the best part all along.\\nAre we gonna smoke this banana or sit…\\nPlay ball!\\n[sentimental music playing]\\n[Hawking barking]\\n[whimpering]\\n[whining]\\n[whines]\\nHey there.\\nAren’t you late for work?\\nYeah. I need to pay the insurance on the house.\\nIt’s in the calendar, but I can’t find the statement.\\nWith that filing system? Shocking.\\nShocking.\\n[Adam] It should all be online.\\n[Ellie] This is how Dad did it.\\nGrab a pile, would you?\\nI’ll be late for school.\\nOh my gosh. You’re right. Okay. Have a great day, honey.\\nAdam.\\n[Adam] Yeah?\\nJust making sure I wasn’t getting mugged.\\nMaybe you are.\\n[mimics attack noises]\\n[mimics defense noises]\\nGet over here! Get over here!\\nAaargh!\\n[Adam chuckles]\\nI love you, honey.\\nLove you too.\\n[man] So, as I said earlier,\\nour goal is to calculate the variability of gravitational force,\\nwhich depends entirely on whether your path of motion\\nis toward the Earth or away from it.\\nSo let’s define the gravitational force of the Earth on an object\\nby Newton’s gravitational formula.\\nF is equal to big G, Newton’s gravitational constant,\\nmultiplied by m sin 1 times m sin 2\\ndivided by r squared.\\nAnd m sin 1 is the mass of the Earth, m sin e,\\nm sin 2 is the mass of the object the Earth is exerting force on.\\nAnd r…\\nCan you believe this guy?\\nHe’s been talking for 15 minutes. Managed to put the entire class to sleep.\\n[lecturer] …force is directly…\\nYou look awake.\\nNo. No, no, no, no, no.\\nI’ve trained myself to…\\nTo fall fast asleep but keep my eyes open.\\nCheck it out.\\n[snoring]\\n[laughs]\\n…gotta believe in the miracle…\\nAre you serious?\\n[snoring]\\nCool, right?\\nYeah.\\nYeah.\\nSuper cool. [chuckles]\\nI’m Adam. Adam… Adam Reed.\\nLaura Shane.\\nNice to meet you.\\nNice to meet you too.\\nI’ll, um… I’ll be quiet.\\nOkay.\\nWhere do they find these guest lecturers?\\n[snickering]\\nRight?\\nIt’s like they’re genetically engineered to bore us to death.\\nYou’re totally a guest lecturer, aren’t you?\\nYes, I am. Yeah.\\nShit.\\nWhat’s your field?\\nUm… computational linguistics.\\nNo way!\\nYeah.\\nI don’t know what that is. Um…\\nOh.\\nWhat does that have to do with flying?\\nUh… not a damn thing.\\nOh.\\nYeah.\\nOh. You’re in the wrong place, I think.\\nThat’s subjective. This is Schaefer 309?\\nLiterally in the wrong place.\\xa0Farrel 309.\\nNo.\\nYep.\\nNo.\\nYeah.\\n[Laura] I don’t think that…\\n[Adam] Yeah. Oof.\\nOkay. Oh.\\nI knew it.\\nOkay. All right.\\nBingo. Yeah.\\nOkay. Okay.\\nThen I’m in the wrong building.\\nActually, you’re in the wrong campus.\\n[sighs]\\nThen I’m lost.\\nNot anymore. I found you.\\nI can… I can walk you to Schaefer.\\nAre you sure? I mean, I would hate to disturb your sleep.\\nI’ve, uh…\\nI’ve got time.\\n[“Let My Love Open the Door” by Pete Townshend]\\nPlus…\\n[snoring]\\n[laughs]\\nOkay.\\nOkay.\\nYeah.\\n♪ When people keep repeatin’ ♪\\n♪ That you’ll never fall in love ♪\\n♪ When everybody keeps retreatin’ ♪\\n♪ But you can’t seem to get enough ♪\\n♪ Let my love open the door ♪\\n♪ Let my love open the door ♪\\n♪ Let my love open the door ♪\\n♪ To your heart ♪\\n♪ Let my love open the door ♪\\n♪ Ooh ♪\\n♪ Let my love open the door ♪\\n♪ Let my love open the door ♪\\n♪ Ooh ♪\\n♪ Let my love open the door ♪\\n♪ Ooh ♪\\n♪ The only key to your heart ♪\\n♪ That can stop you fallin’ apart ♪\\n♪ Try today, you’ll find this way ♪\\n♪ Come on and give me a chance to say ♪\\n♪ Let my love open the door ♪\\n♪ It’s all I’m livin’ for ♪\\n♪ Release yourself from misery ♪\\n♪ There’s only one thing Gonna set you free ♪\\n♪ That’s my love ♪\\n♪ That’s my love ♪\\n♪ Let my love open the door ♪\\n♪ Ooh ♪\\n♪ Let my love open the door ♪\\n♪ Ooh ♪\\n♪ Let my love open the door ♪\\n♪ Ooh ♪\\n♪ Let my love open the door ♪\\n♪ When tragedy befalls you ♪\\n♪ Let my love open the door ♪\\n♪ Ooh ♪\\n♪ Don’t let it drag you down ♪\\n♪ Love can cure your problems ♪\\n♪ Let my love open the door ♪\\n♪ Ooh ♪\\n♪ You’re so lucky I’m around ♪\\n♪ Let my love open the door ♪\\n♪ Let my love open the door ♪\\n♪ Let my love open the door ♪\\n♪ To your heart ♪\\n[sentimental music plays]\\n[dramatic music playing]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore:\\n\\nMovie Transcripts, Shawn Levy, The Adam Project (2022) \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLeave a Comment Cancel ReplyYour email address will not be published.
